## 📘 Summary

In response to the proposed restructuring policies of the **Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)**, tens of thousands of federal workers are projected to be laid off. Federal workers often trade higher salaries for stability and benefits — but what happens when those jobs disappear?

This **interactive Shiny dashboard** explores the potential ripple effects of mass federal layoffs on:
- National unemployment rates  
- Geographic regions heavily reliant on federal jobs  
- Private sector pressure to absorb displaced workers  
- Changes in salary dynamics and workforce expectations

This case study aims to **bridge data analysis and public policy**, offering insight to both technical users (data scientists, analysts) and non-technical stakeholders (advocates, journalists, policymakers).

## 📊 The App: Key Visualizations

### [1. Overview Dashboard](#)
Quick, clear stats to set the stage — including projected layoffs, potential unemployment spikes, and top sectors affected.

---

### [2. Layoffs by Federal Department](#)
A dynamic bar chart showing which agencies (DOE, DHS, VA, HUD, EPA) face the highest job losses. Click to view tooltip data like:
- Average salaries  
- Years of service  
- Most likely private sector transitions

---

### [3. Job Market Heatmap](#)
A color-coded interactive map using `leaflet` to pinpoint regions most affected by federal downsizing (e.g., Washington D.C., San Antonio, Denver).

---

### [4. Private Sector Pressure Tracker](#)
This bar plot showcases sectors with the most significant forecasted demand increases, like:
- Cybersecurity  
- Logistics  
- Healthcare  
Useful for planning reskilling and upskilling programs.

---

### [5. What If Scenarios](#)
Adjust the number of layoffs using a slider and watch the projected national unemployment rate update in real-time.

> _What happens if 100K federal jobs are lost? The U.S. unemployment rate could breach 6.5%._

## 💡 Why This Matters

📌 **Federal employment isn't just a job — it's a stabilizer.** These roles often anchor entire local economies, particularly in cities with large military, security, or administrative operations.

📌 **Displaced workers may flood private sectors unprepared for volume and skill alignment.** Think: a VA nurse looking for work in a saturated healthcare market or a DOE systems analyst transitioning to tech without support.

📌 **It affects all of us — even non-federal employees.** With more competition, benefits expectations may shift. We may all need to re-evaluate salary vs. stability tradeoffs.

This app helps illustrate **what’s at stake** and how different players — from policymakers to job seekers — might need to adapt.

## 💻 Shiny App Code

The full app code is in [`app.R`](./app.R), but here's a [quick preview of the top layout](https://github.com/YourUsername/Federal-Workforce-Fallout/blob/main/app.R):

```r
# Example: Layoffs by Department plot
output$layoffsPlot <- renderPlotly({
  plot_ly(dept_data, x = ~Department, y = ~Layoffs, type = 'bar', text = ~Layoffs,
          marker = list(color = 'rgb(255,99,71)')) %>%
    layout(title = \"Estimated Layoffs by Department\")
})
```

To run this app:
```r
# In your R console
shiny::runApp('app.R')
```

You’ll need these packages:  
```r
install.packages(c(\"shiny\", \"shinydashboard\", \"plotly\", \"leaflet\", \"dplyr\", \"readr\"))
```

## 🔚 Conclusion

We hope this dashboard doesn’t just raise awareness — we hope it **informs solutions**. This isn't just about politics or numbers. It's about **people**.

If you're a researcher, use this tool to model outcomes.  
If you're a veteran or federal employee, explore your career pivot options.  
If you're a policymaker — let's plan better, **before** people fall through the cracks.
