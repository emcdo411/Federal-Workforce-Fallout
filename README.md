# 💼 Federal Workforce Fallout: A Shiny App Case Study

This case study explores the **economic shockwaves** caused by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)'s decision to lay off tens of thousands of federal employees. This interactive Shiny app lets users explore the **impact by department, region, and industry**, and simulates how the private sector might respond to absorb the displaced workforce.

## 🔍 Project Summary

In response to DOGE’s sweeping cost-cutting initiatives, more than **75,000 federal employees** are facing layoffs. These roles, typically lower-salaried but benefit-rich, span from departments like **Veterans Affairs (VA)** to **Housing and Urban Development (HUD)**.

This case study addresses:

- Which **federal departments** are most affected?
- Which **U.S. cities** bear the brunt?
- How might the **private sector** respond?
- What if this expands to **100K+ layoffs**?

The interactive dashboard provides **data-driven answers** to these questions — visually and intuitively.

## 💡 Why This Matters

> 🧠 **Federal employees often accept lower pay in exchange for long-term security and benefits.**
>
> 💼 Their sudden transition into the private workforce alters **salary expectations, skill demands**, and **industry readiness**.

This project explores whether **non-federal employees may also need to adopt new mindsets** around job security, adaptability, and compensation as a result.

This app is more than numbers — it’s about **resilience in workforce ecosystems**.

📌 Conclusion
This project brings transparency to a difficult question:
👉 "What happens when a government downsizes itself?"

The app equips policymakers, economists, and everyday citizens with insights into where the damage is felt and how we might restructure labor in its wake.
